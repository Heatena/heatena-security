## 🚀 What We Do

At the core of Heatena is the **Security Health Check (SHC)** — a fast, anonymous assessment that:

- Identifies vulnerabilities in your digital accounts & setup  
- Highlights the highest-risk issues impacting your privacy and safety  
- Gives clear, non-technical steps to fix them  
- Works anonymously — no email, no signup, no exposure

→ **No security expertise required. No meetings. No friction.**

## 🛡️ Why Heatena Exists

Digital life has never been more valuable — or more exposed.

Cybersecurity shouldn’t require:
- Trusting another company with your personal data  
- Hiring consultants  
- Learning technical jargon  
- Hours of complicated setup  

Heatena flips the script:

| Traditional Security Tools | Heatena |
|---------------------------|---------|
| Require personal data & access | **Anonymous** |
| Built for experts | **Built for real people** |
| Slow audits & high costs | **Instant & self-service** |
| Confusing results | **Clear, human-friendly actions** |

Whether you’re protecting your privacy, lifestyle, business, or financial future — Heatena gives you fast clarity and confidence.
